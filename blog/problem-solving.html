      <h1 class="title1">Problem Solving</h1>
      <h3 class="title3">Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h3>

      <h3 class="title3">1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>

      <h3 class="title4">what was the problem?</h3>
      <p> I was starting to work on a new activity, in the intructions it was mentioned that I will have to use dot notations and bracket notations.
          Notations are options to access the properties of an object, once you have access you can alter the values of the properties. I was already familiar with dot notation, but the article given to learn about bracket notation was not enough for me. 
          It used simple examples, but I was still not getting the concept and the difference with dot notation.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p> The problem-solving technique I used was asking a search engine. I found more articles and videos to learn about these two notations and their difference.

      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">how did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p> A little dumb intially because the examples given were really simple (and I still didn't get it), but after I understood the bracket notation concept and the difference with dot notation it all clicked. I felt glad that I used this technique otherwise I would have struggled to complete the activity.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">what did you learn?</h3>
      <p> Two things: that if I read something twice and still don't get it, I just try to find an alternative option to what I'm trying to understand. Also that I have to think of dot notation as static notations and bracket notations as dynamic notations.
      </p>
        

      <h3 class="title3">2. elegantly solved a problem.</h3>

      <h3 class="title4">what was the problem?</h3>
      <p> During of one the activities on this sprint I was not passing one of the tests. I was struggling to understand what was wrong with my code as everything seemed fine.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p> I decided to use the powerful console.log(). This simple line of code allows you to output messages or values of the code you're working on. In a more simple way it tells you what the result of an operation is.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">how did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p> I felt like I was using a really good technique for when I encounter this type of problems.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">what did you learn?</h3>
      <p> I learned that sometimes it's better to break the code into small parts to make sure I'm getting the results I want before proceeding with more complex parts.
      </p>


      <h3 class="title3">3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Pseudocode:</b> I think this technique can be really useful for when I have to perform several steps to get a result. I realized I didn't use it for this spring, so I will consider it for the future sprints.</li>
          <li><b>Trying something:</b> This is an approach that I try all the time, even when I know that is not going to work I try things to get and idea what I want or need to have a base and then I move on from there until I achieve a result.</li>
          <li><b>Rubber ducky method:</b> Not one of my favourites, not sure why. I guess I should give it a try and reflect how I feel after.</li>
          <li><b>Reading error messages:</b> Eventhough I am aware that this is a really good technique, sometimes it's not my first choice and try something else before actually fully reading an error message. I should try to improve that behaviour.</li>
          <li><b>Console.logging:</b>I feel confident using this one now. I think it will become one of my most used techniques.</li>
          <li><b>Googling:</b>I'm always googling and checking extra sources. One of my favourites techiques to solve most issues.  </li>
          <li><b>Asking your peers for help:</b> I haven't the opportunity, but I will take this into account. </li>
          <li><b>Asking coaches for help:</b>It's an approach I usually take. I don't think I've reached out for help here yet, the reason is so far whenever I have a question, someone has already asked it in a thread.</li>
          <li><b>Improving your process with reflection:</b> This is definetely something I need to incorporate as a habit.</li>

        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3 class="title3">4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h3>

      <p> I can remember situations where I didn't ask for help because I thought people might think that I should know how to solve those problems. I thought people might judge if I ask for help. It's not okay tho think like that, it's something that I'm working on. Next time I will make sure to reach out for help if I feel I need to, regardless of what I think others might think of me.
