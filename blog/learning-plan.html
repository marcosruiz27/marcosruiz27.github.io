      <h3 style="font-size: 14px;">1 - What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 12px;">
        I am currently working as an application support engineer in a Software Company, my goal is upskill and slowly start moving into a software developer/engineer role.
      </p>
      <h3 style="font-size: 14px;">2 - A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 12px;">
          I'm very commited when I feel motivated, I like to dedicate time and effort to projects I enjoy. I schedule time, organise what I want to achieve and stick to the plan. 
          On the other hand, when I don't find something interesting or enjoyable, I sometimes procrastinate. It's harder to stick to the plan and keep motivated. 
        </p>
      <h3 style="font-size: 14px;">3 - What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 12px;">
          Definetely collaboration. Even though I work well in groups I tend to work alone, that  is something I would like to change. I'm looking forwarded to working in team projects and being able to interact with the rest of the cohort. 
        </p>
      <h3 style="font-size: 14px;"> 4 - A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 12px;">
          Except for this week and the week before that I had to travel for work, my weekdays schedules are always the same. So my plan is to dedicate 4 hours a day during weekdays (before or after  work) and the necessary hours during weekends.
          Apart from work I don't have other obligations, I also included in the plan a morning run most days to clear my mind.  
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-size: 14px;">5 - A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            I will reach out for help in Discord to either Shrena or John whenever I feel stuck and can't make any progress in a period of 30 min or when I can anticipate that I won't be able to meet a deadline.
          </p>
       <h3 style="font-size: 14px;">6 - A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            I hope they can provide guidance when I'm feeling stuck or encouragement when I feel frustrated. 
          </p>

          <h3 style="font-size: 14px;">7 - Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 12px;">
            Nope. My brother is visiting in early December. I will probably spend two or three days with him if I see the course is going well and I'm finishing sprint activities on time.
          </p>
