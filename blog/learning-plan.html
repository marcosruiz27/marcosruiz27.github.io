      <h1 class="title1">Learning Plan - Foundations</h1>
      <h3 class="title4">1 - What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p >
        I am currently working as an application support engineer in a Software Company, my goal is upskill and slowly start moving into a software developer/engineer role.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">2 - A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3>
      <p >I'm very commited when I feel motivated, I like to dedicate time and effort to projects I enjoy. I schedule time, organise what I want to achieve and stick to the plan. 
          On the other hand, when I don't find something interesting or enjoyable, I sometimes procrastinate. It's harder to stick to the plan and keep motivated. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">3 - What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p >Definetely collaboration. Even though I work well in groups I tend to work alone, that  is something I would like to change. I'm looking forwarded to working in team projects and being able to interact with the rest of the cohort. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4"> 4 - A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
      <p>Except for this week and the week before that I had to travel for work, my weekdays schedules are always the same. So my plan is to dedicate 4 hours a day during weekdays (before or after  work) and the necessary hours during weekends.
          Apart from work I don't have other obligations, I also included in the plan a morning run most days to clear my mind.  
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">5 - A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
      <p >I will reach out for help in Discord to either Shrena or John whenever I feel stuck and can't make any progress in a period of 30 min or when I can anticipate that I won't be able to meet a deadline.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">6 - A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
      <p>I hope they can provide guidance when I'm feeling stuck or encouragement when I feel frustrated. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">7 - Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
      <p>Nope. My brother is visiting in early December. I will probably spend two or three days with him if I see the course is going well and I'm finishing sprint activities on time.
      </p>

      <h1 class="title1">Learning Plan - Bootcamp</h1>
      <h3 class="title4">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p >
        I'm working in a Software Company as an application support engineer, my goal is upskill and slowly start moving into a software developer/engineer role. 
        If possible I would like to stay in this company, but I don't rule out moving companies if the right opportunity comes.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p >During foundations I had to find ways to deal with frustration. Taking a lot of short breaks worked well for me. My concern with Bootcamp is that time will be precious and I might not be able 
        to take a lot of breaks so I might have to find other alternatives.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <p> I'm not sure if should call it a challenge, but sometimes I'm not good at explaining what I want to say.
          I think what I'm saying makes sense, but it might not be easy to understand for other people. 
          I guess I'm not very efficient when I structure ideas or explanations. My plan is to make sure to think before I express something (verbally or by writing) and make sure I'm providing enough information for the other person to understand me.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p> Exactly the answer to the previous question. I'd like to get better at communicating and explaining ideas.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>I hope we can work well as a team, collaborate, support each other, share wins and cool tricks and maybe celebrate with some drinks when we finish the course.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>I hope I can learn a lot, practice what I learn, enjoy the time it lasts. I hope I will finish without major issues. I want it to be challeinging, I want to enjoy experiecing those challenges. I hope I can get ideas for future projects.
