      <h1 class="title1">Neuroplasticity</h1>
      <h3 class="title3">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
      <p>It is not uncommon for people to believe that the human brain couldn’t change after it was fully developed. Science has recently proven that that belief is not correct. While it is true that brains are more malleable in early ages, they continue to adapt and evolve throughout our entire life. Brains can change (Neuroplasticity). Having a basic understanding of neuroplasticity and its principles allow people to stop limiting themselves, they no longer have the excuse to say that it’s too late to learn something new, or something that was considered too difficult or challenging. These are the 10 principles of neuroplasticity:
      </p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Use It or Lose It:</b> Every thought, action, movement, and skill has a specific set of connections in your brain. When you don’t practise something for an extended period of time, the pathways for that task start to weaken, and they get weaker over time.</li>
            <li><b>Use It and Improve It:</b> However, if you practice something a lot, these connections can grow and become stronger. With aphasia, this means that the more you talk, listen, read, and write, the better your accuracy and speed will be in these areas.</li>
            <li><b>Salience:</b> Emotions can affect the strength of memory consolidation. If therapy is made interesting or important to you (ex: incorporating hobbies or interests), you can more easily remember new skills or pieces of information.</li>
            <li><b>Repetition:</b> Repetition of a learned (or re-learned) behaviour is required for long-term changes in the brain. You need thousands of repetitions to master a skill. The more time you spend practising, the better you perform.</li>
            <li><b>Intensity:</b> If you do something that doesn’t challenge you, you won’t see much of a difference. Intensity can be the number of times you do an exercise or how difficult it is. Try to find an intensity that is one step above your current level.</li>
            <li><b>Specificity:</b> You have to train your brain in very specific ways. Learning something new or re-training an old skill (rather than simply going through the motions of something you already know) helps increase connections in the brain.</li>
            <li><b>Age:</b> Our brains are the most flexible and adaptive when we are young. But connections in our brains can grow and change at any age! Effects are generally better in individuals with greater physical and mental activity.</li>
            <li><b>Time:</b> If therapy targets changing, increasing, and strengthening the pathways in your brain (using these principles), it should work any time. However, there may be windows of time where progress happens at a faster rate.</li>
            <li><b>Transference:</b> Learning in one situation (like therapy) can generalize to other situations (like social settings or the work environment). Similarly, training one specific skill can sometimes activate the pathways of nearby, untrained items and improve those skills as well.</li>
            <li><b>Interference:</b> Neuroplasticity means the brain is always learning. But it doesn’t know the difference between good and bad! Maladaptive habits or practising the wrong things might interfere with the positive changes you want to make.</li>
          </ol>
      </p>

      <h3 class="title3">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
      <p>Based on the principles there are two that I have to take into consideration for my benefits.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Use It or Lose It:</b> Spanish is my native language, I grew up reading lots of books and I was a big fan of grammar and vocabulary. I’ve been living in New Zealand for almost 5 years and I went from speaking/reading Spanish every day, to speaking it twice a week for a couple of minutes with my family back home. I rarely read Spanish now. I recently realised that I am losing vocabulary, I’m making mistakes when I write and the way I speak is not the same any more. I don’t like that. I think it’s time to resume some habits that I had like reading books and writing in a journal to avoid “losing it”.</li>
        <li><b>Intensity:</b> This principle will benefit me during the rest of the course at Dev Academy and even after I finish it as well. To consolidate the things that I’m learning I will try to practise more and increase the intensity with more challenging activities and exercises that can help me familiarise with concepts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="title3">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>Some of the methods that I think can be the most effective are repetition, as stated below, behaviour is required for long-term changes in the brain. And also improving an already existing skill to increase accuracy and speed.

      <p> </p>
      
      
      <h1 class="title1">Growth Mindset</h1>
      <h3 class="title3">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
      <p>A mindset is a person’s beliefs about their abilities and attributes. 
        A growth mindset means that you thrive on challenge, and don’t see failure as a way to describe yourself but as a springboard for growth and developing your abilities. Your intelligence and talents are all susceptible to growth.        
      </p>

      <h3 class="title3">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
      <p>I was surprised at the results of the studies conducted in students. I also remember seeing videos of kids not wanting to perform certain activities that they thought were too scary or difficult. The same kids succeeded after someone told them that they could do it. I believe encouragement plays a great role in a growth mindset.</p>
        
      <h3 class="title3">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>I will follow some of the methods to develop a growth mindset, for example: </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Replace the word “failing” with “learning”:</b> Whenever I visit my partner’s family and friends for the first time, they politely ask if I speak German before starting a conversation. My response was always “No, sorry I don’t” when in reality it should be “Not yet” since I’m already learning and I have the intention to speak the language at some point. It’s difficult and tedious, but I’m on the learning path already. </li>
        <li><b>Find outside help:</b> I think talking to people that have mastered a skill that I’m trying to learn can really help. Not for validation purposes, but for the idea that  they can provide advice and guidance, or simply share their experience that can make me feel encouraged and motivated. </li>
      </ul>

      <p> </p>

      <h1 class="title1">Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h1>
      <h3 class="title3">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
      <p>I can definitely use both Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset methods to influence my learning plan and strategies. </p>
      <p>I know time is limited sometimes, but once I finish this course I will continue practising coding with the objective of increasing accuracy and speed. I remember that in one of the introductory videos, it was said that coding everyday is really effective so I will aim at doing that.</p>
      <p>Transference is another method that I will try to apply to my learning plan. I know that all programming languages are different, but most of them share similar concepts so once I am familiar with one, I will start learning a similar one to expand my knowledge. </p>
