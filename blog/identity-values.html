      <h1 class="title1">Identity Values</h1>
      <h3 class="title3">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
      <p>
        I can't think of any major ethical decision that I had to make. The only thing I can think of is when my sister and I crashed my dad's car while he was on holidays with my mum.
        We were teens and thought it could be fun to drive around town. Neither of us knew how to drive, we crashed it while getting it out from the garage. We could have not said anything and hope my dad wouldn't notice, but we knew how much my dad loved that car, so we decided to tell the truth when he returned. He always taught us to be honest. 
        Looking back it's not just honesty that I reflect on, I also think how stupid that decision was, we were really young and we could have got hurt or hurt someone.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title3">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.</h3>
      <p>I grew up in a rural town where opportunities were limited, in order to get ahead you had to work really hard. That's what my parents taught me. 
          Hard work and perseverance are key to achieve results. I no longer live in that town but I never forget the people that taught me valuable lessons growing up. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="title3">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
        journey.</h3>
      <p>I am usually very organised and structured, I like to dedicate time to the projects I am involved in. I think those types of streghts will be useful for the rest of the course.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title3">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>Sometimes I get frustrated when I am not getting the results I expect, it's sometimes that I am constantly working on. During this learning journey I'm planning on taking small breaks, trying a different approach or reaching out for help whenever I'm stuck and start to feel frustrated.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title3">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
          but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
          time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
          strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
      <p>A couple of years ago I was working as a Monitoring Analyst in a team of 8 people. I worked in the night shift so sometimes I had extra time where I could focus on improving existing processes.
            A coworker and I created a new set of documents and automation tools that would increase productivity and reduce human errors. The proposal to implement these new procedures and tools was not well received among the rest of the team members of the night shift, they didn't like change. They thought that there was no need to improve the existing practices.
            I decided to create a detailed presentation showing the results of the new procedures and the implementation of the new tools, they were hesitant in the beginning but in the end they were all onboard. After a couple of weeks they recognized that the new practices were much better, and because of automation there was more free time during the shift to spend training on new skills.
