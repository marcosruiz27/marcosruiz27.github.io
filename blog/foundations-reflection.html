      <h3 class="title4">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h3>
      <p> These are some of the things I learned:

        <ol>
          <li> I still have the capacity to learn new stuff, even if they are complicated, I just need time, paticence and dedication. </li>
          <li> It is very important to be in contact with my emotions and feelings to be able to process them in a healthy way. </li>
          <li> Actively listening and focusing on what others are saying will make things easier to understand. It sounds obvious, but it's definetely something I need to do more. </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <p>  I think values have to do with characteristics and qualities we see in people we admire. In the context of learning I have always admired people
        that are commited, disciplined and persistent. I believe those values are key in learning and programming.
        
        When you study or work in programming, most of the time you are part of a team (even if you're  completing tasks individually). You are in constant communication
        with others. Members of any team come from different contexts, they might have different skills, they are going through different things in life, they process emotions in a different way, etc.
        That's why it's important to practice empathy to be able to work well as a team. 

        Self-awareness is another key skill as it's extremely important to know what feelings we are going through and what is the best way to express or react to them. 

      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
      <p> The listening and looping activities. We engage in conversations all the time, but to consciously do it makes you focus in a way that you can recall and understand things much easier. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h3>
      <p> I don't remember any topic that was challenging while learning human skills, they will be challenging to put on practice though or some of them at least.
      </p>

      <h3 class="title4">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p> Because at the end of the day developers are humans, we need human skills to be good developers. They are necessary not only to work as a team but also to
          work as individuals. Communication, self-awareness, collaboration, emotional Intelligence are all human skills that can really benefit developers and the teams they're a part of.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title4">Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
      <p> Not at all, it did surprise me that it was part of all sprints but I see the value in it. I think Human skills are as important as programming skills. I learned a lot that I'm already applying
         to my life and I hope I can continue doing it
